**Machine Learning Project: Rainfall Prediction**

**Overview**

This project aims to predict rainfall based on various meteorological characteristics using logistic regression. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether it will rain or not based on input features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project consists of historical meteorological data collected over several years. It includes 22 features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, etc., along with a binary target variable indicating whether it “RainTomorrow” or not.

**Dependencies**

This project is implemented in Python and requires the following dependencies:

•	Python 3.x

•	NumPy

•	Pandas

•	Scikit-learn

•	Matplotlib

•	Seaborn

**Model Training**

The logistic regression model is trained using the historical meteorological data. Data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and encoding categorical variables are applied before training the model.

**Evaluation**

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, and confusion matrix. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance.

**Results**

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 84.3% on the test dataset, 83.9% on the validation dataset . Feature importance analysis reveals that WindGustSpeed, Rainfall, and humidity are the most significant factors affecting rainfall prediction.

**Future Work**

Future enhancements to this project may include:

•	Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting).

•	Tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.

•	Collecting additional features or data sources to enhance prediction accuracy
